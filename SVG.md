# SVG Shapes & Animation Showcase

A comprehensive collection of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) demonstrating both static complex shapes and dynamic SMIL animations.

## ✨ Contents
* **Static Shapes**:
    * **Custom Logo**: A "CC" emblem created using text-anchor and stroke-width properties.
    * **Polygons**: A light blue pentagon and a vibrant yellow star shape defined by precise coordinate points.
    * **Path Geometry**: A complex star outline drawn using the SVG `path` (M/L/Z) commands.
* **Animated Elements**:
    * **Pulsing Circle**: A purple sphere demonstrating scale transformation animations.
    * **Rotating Square**: An orange rectangle showcasing continuous 360-degree rotation.
    * **Fading Text**: An "SVG" text element with looping opacity transitions.
    * **Drawing Line**: A "hand-drawn" effect using `stroke-dashoffset` to animate a pink line from start to finish.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5**: Container for the SVG elements.
* **SVG/SMIL**: Used for defining vector paths and embedding animations directly within the XML code without external heavy libraries.

## 💡 Use Case
This file serves as a reference library for developers looking to implement lightweight, high-performance icons and loaders that remain crisp at any resolution.
