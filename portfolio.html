  <p>Hey, I’m Omkar, and this little corner of the internet is all about my journey—what I’m learning, what I’m building, and who I’m becoming.
I’ve always believed in growth, creativity, and keeping things simple. This website is like my digital diary where I share pieces of my life, my skills, and the things that inspire me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m a student, learner, and someone who loves experimenting with technology.
I enjoy creating aesthetic things—whether it's a web page layout, a project, or something random I coded at 2am.

I’m the kind of person who:
<ul>
  <li>starts a project out of curiosity</li>
  <li>learns things by trying</li>
  <li>keeps improving until it feels right</li>
  <li>and still smiles even when the code breaks </li>
</ul></p>
<hr>
<h4>Skills:-</h4>
<p>I’m not perfect, but I’m improving every single day.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
  <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
  <li>Basic C++ Programming</li>
  <li>Creative Thinking</li>
</ul><hr>
<h4>Sometimes I write random things, sometimes motivational, sometimes something I learned.</h4>
